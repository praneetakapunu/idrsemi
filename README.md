# IDRSEMI - Open Source Chip Design Project

## Overview
This project aims to create a completely open-source chip design that can be taped out using freely available tools and foundries.

## Goals
- Design a functional semiconductor chip using only open-source tools
- Document the complete design flow from concept to tapeout
- Create reproducible results for the open hardware community
- Target an open PDK (Process Design Kit) for manufacturing

## Current Status
- Project initialization ✓
- Tool research and setup (in progress)
- Architecture definition (pending)
- RTL design (pending)
- Verification (pending)
- Physical design (pending)
- Tapeout preparation (pending)

## Progress Updates
Regular progress updates will be provided in PowerPoint format documenting:
- Milestones achieved
- Current challenges
- Next steps
- Technical findings

## Getting Started
See `docs/` directory for detailed setup and design flow documentation.
